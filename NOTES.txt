Kayla Hirano, EE205 Final Project

I used an enum to determine what to draw to the window at a given point. 
The default is set to menu, so the menu screen appears on startup.
If the player presses the "Start Game" button the gamestate changes and
starts the game. This means that my main function looks a little messy, 
since all of my code is there. If I could improve this project, I would
try to seperate this code into different files.

I also was unable to change all my hpp files so that there are no #include. 
If I had more time I would have tried fixing that as well.
